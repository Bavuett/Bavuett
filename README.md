### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
**My name is Lorenzo**, a 18-years-old Computer Science student based in **Pescara, Italy**.

I have always loved Computer Science and technology in general, and this is the reason why I began studying it.
In my opinion, the best way to learn is to have new experiences. For this reason, I created lots of projects with different tools and languages.

The ones I am most proud of are: 
 - [vaccines-in-world](https://github.com/DevLBD/vaccines-in-world): Twitter bot which tweets the percentage of fully vaccinated people in various countries in the world.
 - [Breakout-Java](https://github.com/DevLBD/Breakout-Java): Breakout clone written in Java;
 - [TrisSQL](https://github.com/DevLBD/TrisSQL): TicTacToe which uses an SQL Database to choose its moves;

Other projects you may want to see are [available here](https://github.com/DevLBD?tab=repositories).
