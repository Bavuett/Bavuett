### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
**My name is Lorenzo**, a 18-years-old Computer Science student based in **Pescara, Italy**.

I have always loved Computer Science and technology in general, and this is the reason why I began studying it.
In my opinion, the best way to learn is to have new experiences. For this reason, I created lots of projects with different tools and languages.

The ones I am most proud of are: 
 - [Bricks Crusher](https://github.com/DevLBD/Breakout-Java): Breakout clone written in Java;
 - [TrisSQL](https://github.com/DevLBD/TrisSQL): TicTacToe which uses an SQL Database to choose its moves;
 - [void-rice](https://github.com/DevLBD/void-rice): my (first) Linux Rice I created on my computer which runs Void Linux.

Other projects you may want to see are [available here](https://github.com/DevLBD?tab=repositories).
