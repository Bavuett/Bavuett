### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
**My name is Lorenzo**, a 18-years-old Computer Science student based in **Pescara, Italy**.

I have always loved Computer Science and technology in general, and this is the reason why I began studying it.
In my opinion, the best way to learn is to have new experiences. For this reason, I created lots of projects with different tools and languages.
